## Abstract

Monitoring and examining source code and quality metrics isan essential task in any software development project. Still, it is challenging to evaluate in educational software projects due to the effort requiredand constant change. In this paper, we applied an automated procedureto analyze source code and quality metrics' evolution and impact in software engineering projects using static code analysis on each softwarechange (commits and merges). We examined five undergraduate software engineering projects
changed modules, compilability, and sourcecode and quality metrics (size, complexity, duplication, maintainabilityand security). In total, we assessed 12,103 changes from 103 students contributing in the projects. Our procedure has shown the feasibility ofour approach, allowing us to identify trends and behaviors such as technology knowledge deficiencies, issues in continuous integration practicesand software quality degradation. We believe that the early, constant feedback on student software engineering projects quality can help instructors improve their courses and students better their development skills.
